"""Correlation Breaker: re-shape a submittable Alpha that BRAIN says is already in the pool.

Failing ``PROD_CORRELATION`` means the daily PnL is Pearson-correlated at 0.70 or more with an
Alpha already in production, and this one's Sharpe is not 10% above it. The signal is sound; it
is the *exposure* that is shared. So the settings are never touched here — region, delay,
universe, neutralization, decay and truncation are the source Alpha's, exactly — and only the
expression changes.

Every recipe binds the original expression to one name, ``alpha``, and wraps that. Binding is
appended after the reader's own statements, so it cannot disturb them: FastExpr runs statements
in order, and a name rebound at the end has already been read by everything above it.

The recipes come from what the platform's own guidance says actually works — keep the residual
the crowded drivers do not explain, orthogonalize against them, trade on catalysts rather than
every day, neutralize inside finer clusters, trade the innovation rather than the level — and
never from adding noise, which BRAIN forbids outright and which decays out of sample anyway.

A re-shape adds operators and data fields. For a Power Pool Alpha that can cost it the pool's
limits, so each recipe is counted the way Power Pool counts and says when it would cross them.
