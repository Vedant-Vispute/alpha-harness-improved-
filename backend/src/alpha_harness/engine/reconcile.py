"""Resolve simulations whose send outcome is unknown.

``POST /simulations`` has no idempotency key, so when the answer to one is lost BRAIN may
be running it anyway: resending at once pays twice for the same alpha, and giving up loses
the alpha the quota already paid for.

So such rows wait as ``ORPHANED`` while this pass looks for the alpha they produced among
the account's alphas created around the send. A row with no match once :data:`WINDOW` has
passed is queued again: by then a simulation BRAIN accepted would have finished, so the
likeliest story is that the request never ran.
